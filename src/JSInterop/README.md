# jsinterop

This repo is for `Microsoft.JSInterop`, a package that provides abstractions and features for interop between .NET and JavaScript code.

## Usage

The primary use case is for applications built with Mono WebAssembly or Blazor. It's not expected that developers will typically use these libraries separately from Mono WebAssembly, Blazor, or a similar technology.
